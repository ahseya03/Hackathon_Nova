    <h1>Addressing College Admission Challenges</h1>
</center>
</div>
<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ADD8E6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <h1 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Problem Statement</h1>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        High school students face significant challenges when applying to college, particularly in writing essays and understanding financial aid. The complexity of the college application and admission process, compounded by a lack of accessible guidance, exacerbates these difficulties. Immigrant families, in particular, often lack the necessary knowledge and resources to navigate this intricate process effectively.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Moreover, the high cost of college admission counselors further limits access to valuable assistance, with average rates reaching $82 per hour. Additionally, the scattered nature of available information complicates matters, leaving students without a centralized guide for their college application journey. Furthermore, crucial details such as the benefits of AP classes, lesser-known programs like the Congressional Awards, and opportunities presented by state-wide or nation-wide contests remain hidden from students who lack access to professional counseling.
    </p>
</div>
<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ADD8E6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <h1 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Solution Overview</h1>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Our project introduces an AI counselor to help students with these challenges. We made sure it meets what students need by using survey results.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Our solution is based on the fact that the work that college admission counselors do is almost all based on patterns. These patterns include what percentage of students that got accepted from a specific place took a certain class or joined a certain event. AI can recognize these patterns even better than college counselors and use its data to help students with their college admission process that starts from the moment they enter high school.
    </p>
</div>
<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ADD8E6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <h1 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Unique Value Statement</h1>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Our AI-counselor will be a step towards education equity, as it’s going to be way cheaper than actual college admission counselors. It will help students from all family classes to utilize all the sources out there to get into their dream college.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Additionally, our solution supports immigrant families by providing accessible guidance and resources, addressing the specific challenges they face in navigating the college admissions process.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Furthermore, our AI-counselor eliminates the concept of “hidden” information by leveraging AI algorithms to identify and share valuable insights and opportunities that may not be widely known among students.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Lastly, our AI-counselor ensures quality patterns are recognized and utilized, optimizing students' chances of success by providing tailored guidance based on data-driven insights and proven strategies.

    <h1>Revolutionizing College Admissions with AI Guidance</h1>

    <h2 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">College Admissions Counselor AIs</h2>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">Do College Admissions Counselor AIs not exist already? Well, they do, but they're quite limited in their scope. They serve more as supplements to human counselors rather than replacements. For instance, take Keplan AI. It only answers questions, offers basic info on AP classes, SAT/ACT exams, and provides some essay assistance. However, it doesn't truly guide or recommend, lacking the essence of a real counselor.</p>
</div>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ADD8E6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">

    <ul style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        <li>It's not just going to answer questions; it'll recommend classes and programs tailored to each student.</li>
        <li>It won't just sit there; it'll warn students about factors that might hurt their chances of admission.</li>
        <li>It won't just be a passive helper; it'll make personalized plans for students and explain the best pathways to their dream colleges.</li>
        <li>And guess what? It'll even send notifications about upcoming events and contests. Who needs a human counselor when you've got that?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ADD8E6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <h2 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Utilizing AI</h2>
    <ul style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Well, we're going to build an interactive chatbot, obviously. It'll be like a tireless researcher, constantly scanning the web for the latest info on events and contests.</li>
        <li>And then, there's the heavy lifting: analyzing admission patterns. Our AI will dig deep into the data to uncover what really makes someone more likely to get into a certain college or major.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ADD8E6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <h2 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Why is This the Perfect AI Project?</h2>
    <p style="color: #fff; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">Think about it. College counselors base their work on patterns. They guide students to their dream colleges based on these patterns. And you know what? AI is great at recognizing patterns. It's like a super-powered counselor. Plus, there's a huge gap right now. There's no one place where all the national or state-wide contests and programs are announced. So many students miss out on opportunities they could really benefit from.
